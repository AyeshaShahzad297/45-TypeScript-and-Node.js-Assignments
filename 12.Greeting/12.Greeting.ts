// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names1: string[] = ['Alice', 'Joseph', 'Peter', 'Robert'];

console.log(`Hi ${names1[0]}, you are cordially invited to tonight's party.`);
console.log(`Hi ${names1[1]}, you are cordially invited to tonight's party.`);
console.log(`Hi ${names1[2]}, you are cordially invited to tonight's party.`);
console.log(`Hi ${names1[3]}, you are cordially invited to tonight's party.`);
